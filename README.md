# AI Accelerated Engineering Bootcamp

> **Empowering teams to leverage AI coding assistants for faster, higherâ€‘quality software deliveryâ€”with the right context, workflows, and guardrails.**

## Purpose

This series exists to help teams adopt AI coding assistants thoughtfully and effectively across the entire software lifecycleâ€“from discovery and design to implementation, testing, and delivery. Across sessions, participants develop the mental models (why AI, paradigm shift), the practical skills (context engineering, backlog and architecture creation), and the tool fluency (Copilot modes, MCPs, and comparable assistants) needed to build reliable, humanâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘loop, repeatable workflows. The goal is to accelerate delivery while improving quality and confidence, culminating in a capstone that demonstrates endâ€‘toâ€‘end, realâ€‘world application.
